-- Run a Ubuntu Container Continued --

Containers can be created, run, started and attached to with one step using `docker run.` We should also remove containers when we finish using them. Below are the main commands we went over:

Create, start, run, and attach to a container in one step:
- `docker run --name=bar -it ubuntu bash`

Stop a container:
- `docker stop foo`
Remove a container:
- `docker rm foo`
Force remove a container (stop and remove in one step):
- `docker rm -f foo`
