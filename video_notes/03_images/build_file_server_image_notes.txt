-- Build a File Server Image --

In this video, we build our first Docker image with a custom Dockerfile.
This image uses serve.js, a node.js module used to serve file directories, and static html pages.
Below are the steps we use to create the serve image.

- Create a `serve` directory with an inner `display` directory.
- Place contents to be served into the `display` directory.
- Create a Dockerfile at the root of the project with the following content:
https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/blob/master/serve/Dockerfile
- Build the image: `docker build . -t docker/serve`
- Run a container with the image, and map the host’s 3001 port to the container’s 3000 port:
`docker run --name=serve -p=3001:3000 docker/serve`
- visit http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
