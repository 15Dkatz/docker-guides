-- Build an express.js Image --

In this video, we are building a new image and using express.js to build a containerized web server.

Here is the final result of this video's: https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/tree/master/express

To build and run the container, and view it:
- navigate to the project on the command line
- $ docker build . -t docker/express
- $ docker run --name=express -d -p 3002:80 docker/express
- Go to http://localhost:3002

While building the express container, we covered a few important concepts.
In order to make the container accessible, we hosted it on ‘0.0.0.0’, to allow external connections.
We also used the recommended exec form for the CMD option of the Dockerfile:
- CMD [“node”, “server.js”]
