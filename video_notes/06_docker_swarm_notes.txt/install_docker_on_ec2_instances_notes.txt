-- Install Docker on Ec2 Instances --

After getting access to the ec2 instance, we need to install docker and start the docker daemon.

Here are the steps to install docker on the ec2 instance:
- `sudo yum install -y docker`
- `sudo service docker start`
- `sudo usermod -G docker ec2-user`
- Re-connect to the instance.
 - Try `docker` and `docker container ls`

Note that we also wrote a convenient bash script to quickly connect to our various instances with one command. For example, to connect to the first instance:
- `./cswarm.sh 1`
Or the second:
- `./cswarm.sh 2`

Hereâ€™s the script (substitute the ip addresses for the ones of your instances):
