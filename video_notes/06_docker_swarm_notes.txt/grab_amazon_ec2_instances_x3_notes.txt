-- Grab an Amazon EC2 Cloud Linux Instance (x3) --

As a result of this video, we have three amazon ec2 linux instances that we can turn into nodes for a docker swarm cluster. Essentially, we’ll soon install docker on all three systems, and then group them together. This “grouping” will create a swarm, which allows us to pool each of three machine’s docker engines to balance the load for running services and applications.

Here are the steps we took to create each ec2 instance, and prepare it for becoming a node in a docker swarm:
- Get an AWS account.
- Go to `Instances` on the sidebar.
- Launch an instance. Select `AWS Linux` (the first option usually)
- Select `t2.micro` (free tier eligible)
- Click `Edit security groups`
- Add the following rules, accepting all connections: SSH port 22, HTTP port, 80, TCP port 2377, UDP port 4789, and TCP+UDP on 7946.
- Click `launch`
- Create a new key pair and name it something similar to `swarm-nodes`. Download the .pem file.
- Click `launch`
- Make the .pem file private: `chmod 400 swarm-nodes.pem`
- Go to the instances, and look at the instance description (click on its checkbox to open the description). Make a note of the `public ipv4 address`.
- Finally, ssh into the instance (Make sure you’re in the directory where swarm-nodes.pem is located):
`ssh -i swarm-nodes.pem ec2-user@<public ipv4 address>`. 
Should look something like `ssh -i `swarm-nodes.pem ec2-user@192.10.0.31`

If all goes well, you’re now running a shell within the ec2 instance.
