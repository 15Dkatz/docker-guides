-- Compose a Two-Container App - Part One --

In this video, we start building our first multi-container application with Docker Compose.
This consists of a node container, and soon, a php container.
In this video, we set up the Node side of the project.
We also create a docker-compose.yml file in order to configure the project.

Here’s the completed project. Note that we haven’t done the php portion of the project yet, which we’ll go through in the next video:
