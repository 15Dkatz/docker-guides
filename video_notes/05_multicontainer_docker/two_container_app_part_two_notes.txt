-- Compose a Two-Container App - Part Two --

In this video, we complete our first multi-container application with Docker Compose.
After building the node container in the last video, we add the php container in this one

Here is the completed project:
https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/tree/master/node-php

After cloning the project, run:
- $ docker-compose up
If you need to update an image, launch docker-compose using the `--build` option:
- $ docker-compose up --build
