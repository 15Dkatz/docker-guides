-- Docker Swarm - Scale Services and Explore the Routing Mesh --

In this video, we create our first docker swarm, and explored its various features such as the routing mesh.
First, we initialize a swarm in a linux instance.
And then in our other two instances, we join that swarm as worker nodes.

To initialize the swarm:
- Go to the first linux instance
- Run `ifconfig` and make a note of the ip address under `eth0`
- `docker swarm init --advertise-addr=<ip address>`, something like:
`docker swarm init --advertise-addr=172.31.17.31`
- make a note of the printed `docker swarm join…` command, as this will be run in other instances to join the swarm as workers.

In the other instances, join the swarm as workers with the copied command from the step above. Something like:
- $ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-592fo0c31guwi9cw58jpq9do1o5jzyw5fzbk9dwiw8bm4xxpad-94vn587o9o3r73h3e5esujxm9 172.31.17.31:2377

Back in the manager node (the first linux instance):
- List the nodes in the swarm: `docker node ls`
- $ docker network ls
- $ docker network inspect ingress # (Note the “Peers” section)
- Start a service: $ docker service create --name=site --publish=80:80 nginx
- Visit the public ip address of any of the linux instances to see the routing mesh in action.
- Create replicas of the running nginx container across the swarm: $ docker service update --replicas 6 site
