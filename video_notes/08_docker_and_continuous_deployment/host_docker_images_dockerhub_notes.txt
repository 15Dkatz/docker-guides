-- Host Docker Images with Dockerhub --

We explored hosting docker images with Docker Hub.
Weâ€™ve created quite a few of our own custom Docker images with Dockerfiles, and now we have the power to make them available for public use with Dockerhub.
Below are the main commands we used for image hosting:

- Log in to your dockerhub account: `docker login`
- Build and tag an image to host. For example, the serve project: `docker build . -t docker/serve`
- Push it to dockerhub: `docker push docker/serve`
