-- Automatic Image Builds with Github and Amazon ECR --

In this video, we connect a few tools: an amazon ECR private container repository, a github repository, and a Github Actions workflow.

1. The Amazon ECR private container repository allows us to store docker images, as large files, where we can have up to 50 GB of free storage monthly.
2. The github repository is a place to keep track of changes to the container's source code.
3. The Github Actions workflow sets up a continuous deployment process where a new image is built and deployed to Amazon ECR every time a change is committed to the master branch of the github repository.

We also explore some additional minor concepts related to these tools, such as Github Actions secrets, .gitignore files, and more
