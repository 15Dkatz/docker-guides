-- Custom Networks, Compose another Multicontainer Application - Part One --

In this video, we start building another multi-container application in the hope of creating a private network setup.
This multi-container app will eventually have a postgresql, node.js, express.js, and a php container.
The private network will allow for isolated communication between a subset of these containers.

This video demonstrates goes over building the postgresql container.
Note that we can set up database data by sending sql scripts to the /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ directory of the postgresql container.

Hereâ€™s the completed project code: https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/tree/master/compose-networks
Note that we only complete postgresql so far.
However the code for the project also has all the code for the next parts: node, flask, and php.
