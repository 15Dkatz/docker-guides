-- Volumes - Update Compose Containers Dynamically --

In this lesson, we use volumes to dynamically update our compose application.
Previously, we used volumes in order share data across containers in a specific Docker-managed directory.
With Docker Compose though, we can use volumes in a different way.
This time, we connect specific directories on the host machine to ones in our container services.
With the volumes for our node and php services set up, we gain the ability to dynamic update our compose application as we save and edite files in the application.

Hereâ€™s the completed project:
