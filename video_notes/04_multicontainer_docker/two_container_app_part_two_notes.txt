-- Compose a Two-Container App - Part Two --

We completed our first multi-container application with Docker Compose. After building the node container first, we added the php container next.

Here is the completed project:
https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/tree/master/node-php

After cloning the project, run:
`docker-compose up`
If you need to update an image, launch docker-compose using the `--build` option:
`docker-compose up --build`
