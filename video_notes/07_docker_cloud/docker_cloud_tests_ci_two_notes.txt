We now have a continuous integration workflow with Docker Cloud and Github. With this setup, we have configured automatic tests to run every time a pull request opens for our `serve` project on Github.

To configure this automatic testing environment, we created a docker-compose.test.yml file. This docker-compose.test.yml file contains a special service called `sut` (system under test) which is a testing container that runs a test script. This script exits with either a 0 (pass) or 1 (fail) to notify docker of whether or not the tests have passed.

In this project directory, there is a completed docker-compose.test.yml file, as well as a relevant tests/ directory for the testing container:


Finally, to set up the automatic testing, head to Docker Cloud:
https://github.com/15Dkatz/docker-guides/tree/master/serve

- Go to the `configure build` option for your desired project.
- Turn on `automatic testing`
- Open a couple pull requests, and watch the automatic tests run.
